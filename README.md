An example of OAuth external service that uses the Restlet OAuth example server.

### Restlet OAuth Server security flaw
Please note that the example server is flawed which I have detailed (here)[http://bretkikehara.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/restlet-2-2-oauth/].

Although the implementation is not fully secure, (i.e. no HTTPS implementation), it is sufficient enough to prove that how to implment an OAuth sevice using the Restlet framework.

### Notice
Code has been slightly modified from the original project located (here)[https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java].
